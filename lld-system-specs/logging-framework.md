## **Design Logging Framework**

### **Requirements:**
1. The logging framework should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.
2. It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
3. The framework should support multiple destinations, such as console, file, and database.
4. It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
5. It should be extensible to support new log levels and output destinations in the future.
6. The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging  from multiple threads.
