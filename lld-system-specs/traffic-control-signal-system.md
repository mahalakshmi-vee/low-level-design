## **Design Traffic Control Signal System**

### **Requirements:**
1. The traffic signal system should control the flow of traffic at an intersection with multiple roads.
2. The system should support different types of signals, such as red, yellow, and green.
3. The duration of each signal should be configurable and adjustable based on traffic conditions.
4. The system should handle the transition between signals smoothly, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow.
5. The system should be able to detect and handle emergency situations, such as ambulance or fire truck approaching the intersection.
6. The system should be scalable and extensible to support additional features and functionality.

#### About the system:

1. These systems are used to regulate the flow of traffic at intersections and crossings, helping to ensure the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians.

2. Typically, the system consists of traffic lights (signals) that change in a set of sequence, such as red, yellow, and green, to control traffic in different directions.

3. Some systems are controlled by timers, while others use sensors to detect traffic volume and adjust signal timing accordingly.

Timers based system control:

When a traffic signal system is controlled by timers, it means that the lights change at predetermined time intervals - regardless of how much traffic is present. So the signal changes automatically after a set amount of time, without considering the traffic conditions at the moment.

Example:

Imagine an intersection with a traffic signal system where the lights follows a simple timer:
1. Red light for 30 seconds.
2. Green light for 45 seconds.
3. Yellow light for 5 seconds.

So, every time the light cycle runs, it would stay red for 30 seconds, then green for 45 seconds, and yellow for 5 seconds - whether there are cars waiting or not.

This system is suitable well in situations where traffic flow is predictable and doesn't vary too much. For example, a quiet residential area where traffic doesn't change much during the day. However, it might not as efficient in busy places where traffic levels change frequently, which is why more advanced systems are often used in busy areas.

#### System Recommendation:

Timer-based traffic control system: 
Best suited for areas with predictable traffic volumes, like residential neighbourhoods. Since the traffic flow is usually consistent, the fixed timer system can efficiently regulate signal changes without needing to adjust based on real-time conditions.

Sensor-based advanced system:
Ideal for busy, unpredictable areas (like urban areas, commercial districts or city centers). These systems use sensors (such as inductive loops, cameras, or radar) to detect the actual number of vehicles waiting at the intersection. Based on the data, the system dynamically adjust signal timings, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.
