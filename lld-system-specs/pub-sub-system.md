## **Designing a Pub-Sub System in Java**

### **Requirements:**
1. The Pub-Sub system should allow publishers to publish messages to specific topics.
2. Subscribers should be able to subscribe to topics of interest and receive messages published to those topics.
3. The system should support multiple publishers and subscribers.
4. Messages should be delivered to all subscribers of a topic in real-time.
5. The system should handle concurrent access and ensure thread safety.
6. The Pub-Sub system should be scalable and efficient in terms of message delivery.

About Message Broker:

* Message Broker is a system that enables different applications or services communicate with each other by exchanging messages.

* Publishers publishes messages to an intermediary known as Message Broker or Event Bus.

* Subscribers express interest in certain type of messages and receives them via the Message Broker or Event Bus.

Real-World Use Cases of Message Brokers:

* A message broker is a middleware component that facilitates communication between distributed applications, services, or systems by enabling asynchronous message exchange.

* It helps decouple producers and consumers, ensuring reliable and scalable message delivery.

1. Microservices Communication:      
   * In microservices architecture, services need to communicate asynchronously.
   * Example: A ride-hailing app (like uber) where a "Trip Service" sends a ride requests to a queue, and a "Driver Matching Service" consumes them.      

2. Event-Driven Architecture:
   * Helps in real-time event propogation across distributed systems.
   * Example: E-Commerce platforms (like Amazon) where an "Order service" publishes an event when an order is placed, and muliple services (Inventory, Payment, Notification) consumes the       event.   

3. Logging and Monitoring:
   * Message brokers can collect logs from multiple sources and forward them to log aggregators.
   * Example: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) pipelines use Kafka for real-time log processing.
  
4. Data Streaming and Analytics:
   * Message brokers facilitate real-time data streaming for analytics and processing.
   * Example: Stock trading platforms (like Nasdaq) use Kafka or RabbitMQ to stream market data updates to traders in real-time. 

5. IoT (Internet of Things) Applications:
   * IoT devices generate data that needs to be processed asynchronously.
   * Example: Smart Home Automation (like Google Nest) where IoT sensors publish temperature/humidity data to a broker (e.g., MQTT), and consumers (mobile apps, cloud storage) process the 
     data.

6. Real-Time Notifications and Alerts:
   * Push notifications are delivered asynchronously using message brokers.
   * Example: Social Media Platforms (like Twitter, Instagram) use Kafka or Redis Pub/Sub to send real-time notifications for likes, comments, or new messages. 

7. Payment Processing Systems:
   * Payment transactions require asynchronous processing for reliability.
   * Example: FinTech companies (like Stripe, Paypal) use message brokers to handle transaction between banks, fraud detection services, and user accounts.
     
8. E-Commerce Order Fulfillment:
   * Orders needs to be processed by multiple subsystems like payments, inventory, and shipping.
   * Example: Amazon uses Kafka to ensure that order events are consumed by inventory and fulfillment services reliably.
