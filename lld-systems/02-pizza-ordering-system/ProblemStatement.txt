You need to design a Pizza Ordering System that allows customers to order pizzas, choose toppings, and calculate final cost of the pizza.
The system should be simple, allowing customer to:
1. Choose a base pizza type.
2. Add optional toppings.
3. Calculate the total cost of the pizza (base pizza cost + toppings cost)
4. Display a summary of the pizza order.

Functional Requirements:

Pizza Types: There should be at least three types of pizzas:
Margherita Pizza
Pepperoni Pizza
Farmhouse Pizza

Toppings: The pizza types can have optional toppings:
Cheese
Olives
Mushrooms
Each topping has a fixed cost that will be added to the base pizza price.

Order Creation: The customer should be able to:
Choose one of the pizza types.
Add one or more toppings to the pizza.
Calculate the total price of the pizza (Base Pizza + Toppings).

Display Summary: The system should display:
The selected pizza type.
The added toppings.
The total price of the pizza.
