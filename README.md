# Low Level Design (LLD):
Low Level Design (LLD) is the process of specifying and defining the detailed design of a software system.

This design provides the foundation for High Level Design (HLD), which defines a system's overall architecture and design.

## LLD Roadmap:

#### Learn about the DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
      1. SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open for Extension & Closed for Modification, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segmentation, Dependency Inversion)
      2. DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
      3. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
      4. YAGNI (You Are Not Gonna Neet It)

#### Learn about the UML Diagrams:
      1. Generalization (Is-A Relationship)
      2. Association (Has-A Relationship)
      3. Aggregation
      4. Composition
      5. Dependency
      6. Multiplicity
      7. Class Diagrams
      8. Sequence Diagrams

           ii.  Abstract Factory
           iii. Singleton
           iv.  Builder
      2. Structural Design Patterns
           i.   Adapter
           ii.  Proxy
           iii. Decorator
           iv.  Composite
           v.   Bridge
           vi.  Facade
           vii. Fly-Weight
      3. Behavioural Design Patterns
           i.   Observer
           ii.  Strategy
           iii. Chain-Of-Responsibility
           iv.  Iterator
           v.   Interpreter
           vi.  Command
           vii. Template
