# Low Level Design (LLD):
Low Level Design (LLD) is the process of specifying and defining the detailed design of a software system.

This design provides the foundation for High Level Design (HLD), which defines a system's overall architecture and design.

## LLD Roadmap:
#### Learn about the OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System) Concepts:
      1. Classes, Objects
      2. Polymorphism
      3. Inheritance
      4. Abstraction
      5. Encapsulation
#### Learn about the DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
      1. SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open for Extension & Closed for Modification, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segmentation, Dependency Inversion)
      2. DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
      3. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
      4. YAGNI (You Are Not Gonna Neet It)

#### Learn about the UML Diagrams:
      1. Generalization (Is-A Relationship)
      2. Association (Has-A Relationship)
      3. Aggregation
      4. Composition
      5. Dependency
      6. Multiplicity
      7. Class Diagrams
      8. Sequence Diagrams
#### Learn about the Design Patterns:
      1. Creational Design Patterns
           i.   Factory
           ii.  Abstract Factory
           iii. Singleton
           iv.  Builder
      2. Structural Design Patterns
           i.   Adapter
           ii.  Proxy
           iii. Decorator
           iv.  Composite
           v.   Bridge
           vi.  Facade
           vii. Fly-Weight
      3. Behavioural Design Patterns
           i.   Observer
           ii.  Strategy
           iii. Chain-Of-Responsibility
           iv.  Iterator
           v.   Interpreter
           vi.  Command
           vii. Template
