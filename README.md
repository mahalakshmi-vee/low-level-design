# Low Level Design (LLD):
Low Level Design (LLD) is the process of specifying and defining the detailed design of a software system.

This design provides the foundation for High Level Design (HLD), which defines a system's overall architecture and design.

## LLD Roadmap:
#### Learn about the OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System) Concepts:
      1. Classes, Objects
      2. Polymorphism
      3. Inheritance
      4. Abstraction
      5. Encapsulation
#### Learn about the DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
      1. SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open for Extension & Closed for Modification, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segmentation, Dependency Inversion)
      2. DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
      3. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
      4. YAGNI (You Are Not Gonna Neet It)
      5. GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Sotware Patterns)
#### Learn about the UML Diagrams:
      1. Generalization (Is-A Relationship)
      2. Association (Has-A Relationship)
      3. Aggregation
      4. Composition
      5. Dependency
      6. Multiplicity
      7. Class Diagrams
      8. Sequence Diagrams
#### Learn about the Design Patterns:
      1. Creational Design Patterns
           i. Factory
          ii. Abstract Factory
         iii. Singleton
          iv. Builder
      2. Structural Design Patterns
            i.  Adapter
           ii.  Proxy
          iii.  Decorator
           iv.  Composite
            v.  Bridge
           vi.  Facade
          vii.  Fly-Weight
      3. Dehavioural Design Patterns
           i.  Observer
          ii.  Strategy
          iii. Chain-Of-Responsibility
          iv.  Iterator
           v.  Interpreter
          vi.  Command
         vii.  Template

#### Level 1 Practise Problems
      1. Design Parking Lot
      2. Design a Vending Machine
      3. Design Stack Overflow
      4. Design Logging Framework
      5. Design Coffee Vending Machine
      6. Design Traffic Signal Control System
      7. Design a Task Management System
