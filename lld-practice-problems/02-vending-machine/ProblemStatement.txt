Design Vending Machine

What is Vending Machine:
A vending machine is an automated machine that dispenses products, usually food and beverages, to customers after they insert money (coins, bills, or digital payments) or a token. These machines are typically found in public places like offices, schools, hospitals, or shopping centers.

Key Features of Vending Machine:
  * Products Offered: Common items include snacks (chips, candy, nuts), drinks (soda, water, juice), and sometimes even non-food items like     
    toiletries or electronics.

  * Payment Methods: Most vending machines accept coins, bills, credit/debit cards, and sometimes mobile payments or contactless options (like NFC).
  
  * Automated: Once the payment is made, the machine automatically dispenses the selected product, making it a quick and convenient option for   
    people on the go.
