What is Vending Machine:
A vending machine is an automated machine that dispenses products, usually food and beverages, to customers after they insert money (coins, bills, or digital payments) or a token. 
These machines are typically found in public places like offices, schools, hospitals, or shopping centers.

    toiletries or electronics.

  * Payment Methods: Most vending machines accept coins, bills, credit/debit cards, and sometimes mobile payments or contactless options (like NFC).
  
  * Automated: Once the payment is made, the machine automatically dispenses the selected product, making it a quick and convenient option for   
    people on the go.
