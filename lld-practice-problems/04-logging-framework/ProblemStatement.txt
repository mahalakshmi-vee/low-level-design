Design Logging Framework

What is Logging Framework:
  Logging Framework is a system that allows applications to log messages at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) and direct them to different outputs like console, files, or external systems.

How the system works:
  1. User Logs a Message: The application calls the logging framework to log a message with a specified level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).
  2. Log Level Filtering: The system checks if the log level is enabled based on the configurations.
  3. Formatting: The log message is formatted with timestamps, log level, and message details.
  4. Appending: The formatted log is sent to the appropriate output (console, file, database, etc.,).

Core Features:
  * Supports multiple log levels (INFO, ERROR, WARN, DEBUG).
  * Configurable output destinations.
  * Thread-safe logging for concurrent applications.
  * Ability to filter logs based on severity.
