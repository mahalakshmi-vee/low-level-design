# Design a Parking Lot

1. Parking Lot Structure:
    * The parking lot will have multiple floors.
    * Each floor has a set of rows and columns that define the parking spots.
    * Each parking spot is uniquely identified by a Spot ID and is suitable for a specific vehicle type (e.g two wheeler, four wheeler).

2. Simple Spot Allocation - First Available Spot Allocation (FASA):
    * When a person arrives to park their vehicle:
        a. The system identifies the vehicle type.
        b. The system then searches for the first available parking spot that fits the vehicle type. This search starts from the first floor,               first row and first column.
        c. The system assigns the first available parking spot and updates its status to occupied.

3. Ticket Generation:
    * After the parking spot is selected and reserved, the system generates a ticket for the user. 
    * The ticket contains:
        a. Ticket ID (unique identifier for the parking session)
        b. Vehicle Number (license plate number of the vehicle)
        c. Spot ID (the unique id of the allocated parking spot)
    * The parking spot remains reserved for the vehicle for the duration of the session.
    * The user is provided with the ticket, which will be used later for vehicle pick up.

5. Vehicle Pickup Process:
    * When the person returns to pick up their vehicle, they present their Ticket ID.
    * The system uses the Ticket ID to look up the Spot ID associated with the ticket.
    * The parking spot is then released and marked as available.
    * The ticket status is updated to picked-up, indicating that the vehicle has been removed, and the spot is now free for others.

6. System State Management:
    * The system continously track the status of each parking spot:
        a. Whether the spot is available or occupied.
        b. The Ticket ID and Vehicle Number for occupied spots.
    * The system ensures there is no double-booking of spots and that the parking lot operates smoothly.
    * The First Available Spot Allocation (FASA) strategy ensures that the system remains simple and efficient, as it always selects the first         available spot for the given vehicle type.


Future Enhancements (After Initial Phase):
  * Proximity to Entrance:
      As the system grows, you can implement a strategy that prefers parking spots closer to entrance or exit.

  * Spot Preferences (Shaded, Covered Spots, etc):
      Allow the system to take user preferences into account, such as selecting a shaded spot or covered spot if available, especially in              outdoor lots.

  * Optimization for Long-term Parking: 
      If a user parks for a long duration (e.g., all-day or overnight), the system could prioritize long term paking spots that are farther from       the entrance to free up spots near the entrance for short-term parkers.
